# Pride Bar

<img src="https://ps.w.org/pride-bar/assets/icon-128x128.png" align="left">Add an LGBTQIA+ flag design to your admin bar.

Originally added to WordPress.com and viewable by Australian users to support marriage equality, I have bought the rainbow flag to everyone's Admin Bar, via this plugin. But that's not all, as it now supports 33 different LGBTQIA+ flags.

How to use? Just install, activate and enjoy a new flag colored admin bar. Different designs are available - head to Settings -> General to change the theme. And, thanks to code by [Mika Epstein](https://halfelf.org/2017/make-wordpress-gay/ "Make WordPress Gay"), you can modify the positioning of the flag too - allow it to flow behind your Admin Bar menu options or go around it.

Thanks to for Michael Arestad for writing the original code and Pento [for sharing it](https://gist.github.com/pento/bc4574b8eb0f4500efbeb75ec7d8630c). And particularly to the LGBTQIA+ community for having such awesome symbols.
