# Pride Bar

<img src="https://ps.w.org/pride-bar/assets/icon-128x128.png" align="left">Add a rainbow flag design to your admin bar.

Originally added to WordPress.com and viewable by Australian users, it was to show support as a company for marriage equality, which was part of a national survey that was taking part in that country. And many people liked it, not just Australians, so this plugin brings it back for anyone who wants it.

How to use? Just install, activate and enjoy a new rainbow/pride flag colored admin bar. Different designs are available - head to Settings -> General to change the theme.

Thanks to for Michael Arestad for writing the original code, Pento [for sharing it](https://gist.github.com/pento/bc4574b8eb0f4500efbeb75ec7d8630c) and [Mika Epstein](https://halfelf.org/2017/make-wordpress-gay/ "Make WordPress Gay") for her alternative theme suggestion. And particularly to the LGBT community for having such an awesome symbol.
