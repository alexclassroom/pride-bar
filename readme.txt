== Description ==

🏳️‍🌈 Add a pride flag design to your admin bar.

Originally added to WordPress.com and viewable by Australian users to support marriage equality, I have bought the rainbow flag to everyone's Admin Bar, via this plugin. 

But that's not all, as it now supports 14 different pride flags...

1. Aftgender
2. Agender
3. Aromantic
4. Asexual
5. Bigender
6. Bisexual
7. Ceterosexual
8. Demiboy
9. Demifluid
10. Demigender
11. Demigirl
12. Demineutrois
13. Deminonbinary
14. Demixenogender
15. Gay Men
16. Gender Nonconforming
17. Genderfae
18. Genderfluid
19. Genderqueer
20. Intersex
21. Lesbian
22. Lipstick Lesbian
23. Neutrois
24. Non-binary
25. Omnisexual
26. Pangender
27. Pansexual
28. Polysexual
29. Pride (Gilbert Baker)
30. Pride (More Colour More Pride)
31. Pride (Traditional)
32. Quintgender
33. Transgender

And, thanks to code by [Mika Epstein](https://halfelf.org/2017/make-wordpress-gay/ "Make WordPress Gay"), you can modify the positioning of the flag too - allow it to flow behind your Admin Bar menu options or go around it.

How to use? Just install, activate and enjoy a new pride flag colored admin bar. Different designs are available - head to Settings -> General -> Pride Bar to change the flag and positioning.

Thanks to for Michael Arestad for writing the original code and Pento [for sharing it](https://gist.github.com/pento/bc4574b8eb0f4500efbeb75ec7d8630c). And particularly to the LGBT community for having suc awesome symbols.

== Installation ==

Pride Bar can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration (Plugins -> Add New). Alternatively, it can be downloaded from WordPress.org and installed manually...

1. Upload the entire `pride-bar` folder to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress administration.

Voila! It's ready to go.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I submit my own theme? =

Yes you can. If you take a look at the plugin folder, you'll see a sub-folder named `css` - in that is the CSS for each theme. Simply modify one of those to your taste then, if you'd like to share it, send it along to me and I'll look to include it in future releases, complete with its own unique name.
